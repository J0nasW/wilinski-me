## Publications

### The AI Innovation Compass: Constructing Semantic Networks from AI Concepts to Identify and Measure Technology Innovation
- **Venue:** DRUID Conference, 2024
- **Author:** Jonas Wilinski
- **Summary:** Develops an AI Concept List derived from an unsupervised pipeline to track AI diffusion as a General Purpose Technology across 19 research domains. Uses semantic networks built from 10,000+ AI terms to measure adoption patterns across scientific disciplines. Validates the approach with logistic regression against established classification systems.

### Attention-Based Concept Mining and Community Detection in AI Research
- **Venue:** Academy of Management Annual Meeting, 2025
- **Author:** Jonas Wilinski
- **Summary:** Proposes a framework merging attention-based concept mining with co-authorship network analysis. Uses transformer attention maps to mine AI concepts from over 500,000 papers sourced from PapersWithCode. Analyzes concept diffusion across research communities and co-authorship networks.
