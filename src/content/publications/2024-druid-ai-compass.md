tldr: "This paper presents the 'AI Innovation Compass', a novel approach to measure technology innovation by constructing a comprehensive, weighted list of AI concepts to track the diffusion of AI as a General Purpose Technology across 19 research domains."
keyPoints:
  - "Develops a comprehensive AI Concept List of 10,000+ terms using an unsupervised pipeline collecting data from books, ontologies, and PapersWithCode."
  - "Utilizes Semantic Networks to map and visualize the adoption of AI technologies across diverse fields like Medicine, Environmental Science, and Economics."
  - "Validates the concept list through Logistic Regression, assigning importance weights to identify substantive vs. generic AI terms."
  - "Demonstrates AI's role as a General Purpose Technology, providing a quantitative tool for tracking innovation trends and cross-domain applications."

This paper explores the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a General Purpose Technology and its dual role in driving and sustaining innovation across various domains. Central to this paper is the development of an AI Concept List and it's application onto research papers to generate several semantic networks. Numerous stages are involved, including data acquisition and keyphrase extraction, extension through semantic similarities and validation using regression analysis. The AI Concept List, created through a custom unsupervised machine learning pipeline, consists of clustered keyphrases that encapsulate the broad field of AI, each annotated with an importance weight to aid in-depth analysis in various research and industry domains. The findings unveil a steady rise in the prevalence of AI concepts across certain research domains. Subsequent discussions delve into potential implications, practical applications, and inherent limitations alongside with future research directions and subsequent improvements. This work proposes a novel methodology for measuring innovation, aiming to benefit the academic and industrial communities by highlighting groundbreaking innovations and uncovering AI applications in new domains.
